Dice Game

Welcome to the Dice Game! This is a simple two-player game where you roll dice to accumulate points and compete to be the first to reach 100 points.

How to Play

Roll Dice: Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. Each roll adds to your current round score.
Hold: Click the "Hold" button to secure your current round score and pass the turn to the next player.
Scoring: If you roll a 1, you lose all your round score and the turn passes to the next player. Otherwise, your round score keeps accumulating.
Winning: The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
